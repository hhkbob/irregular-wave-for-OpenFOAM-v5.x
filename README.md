# irregular-wave-for-OpenFOAM-v5.x
The irregular wave codes for OpenFOAM v5.x is based on the Airy's theory. The aim is achieved by combining multiple Airy waves together.

The validated waves (line with * is theory wave, the red solide line is simulation)

// All the examples are ran in the "tutorials/Multiphase/interFoam/laminar/wave"

// The first validation-- only one component (The Airy wave)
wave length 300m, wave amplitude 2.5m, phase 0
